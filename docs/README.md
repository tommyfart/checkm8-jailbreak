# checkm8-jailbreak
A semi-tethered jailbreak made by me and inspired by checkra1n.

This probably might or might not release because im
having a hard time learning C and i want to learn
Objective-C and Assembly (ARM64) and i dont know
how to make BootROM and checkm8, kernel exploits
and i dont know where to learn from so yeah.
